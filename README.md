# RemoteOK Job Scraper

Scrape data from [RemoteOK](https://remoteok.com/) easily with RemoteOK Job Scraper

## How to use

In order to use RemoteOK Job Scraper you don't really need to provide any input. In that case you will get 50 results without any filtering.

In order to scrape jobs by tag and to get more results you can provide input values for `tag` and `maxNumberOfListings`.

### Example

If we want to scrape jobs for `java` and to get 500 results input would look like this:

```json
{
  "tag": "java",
  "maxNumberOfListings": 500
}
```

```json
[
  {
